dry, horribly indented
have found some traces of water in the red soil. 
we are trying to make a sample out of it.

This is Delta/Mars, I have a msg for the master.
Mars has been under precise supervision. 
We will update you once we get the breakthrough

This is Delta/Mars, There is a storm coming on the mars. we are trying to hide the spaceship behind the mountain of hope.
The signal will be weak for next few months.

Hi this is Delta/Mars, It is great to see you master. The storm has passed on and it couldnt let us contact you.
We have resumed the operations now. The samples are safe but we are running out of food.
